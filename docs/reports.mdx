# Reports

## Execution log

The `nextflow log` command shows information about executed pipelines in the current folder:

```bash
nextflow log <RUN_NAME> [options]
```

:::{note}
Both the [execution report](#execution-report) and the [trace file](#trace-file) must be specified when the pipeline is first called. By contrast, the `log` option is useful after a pipeline has already run and is available for every executed pipeline.
:::

By default, `log` prints the list of executed pipelines:

```console
$ nextflow log
TIMESTAMP            RUN NAME         SESSION ID                            COMMAND
2016-08-01 11:44:51  grave_poincare   18cbe2d3-d1b7-4030-8df4-ae6c42abaa9c  nextflow run hello
2016-08-01 11:44:55  small_goldstine  18cbe2d3-d1b7-4030-8df4-ae6c42abaa9c  nextflow run hello -resume
2016-08-01 11:45:09  goofy_kilby      0a1f1589-bd0e-4cfc-b688-34a03810735e  nextflow run rnatoy -with-docker
```

Specifying a run name or session id prints tasks executed by that pipeline run:

```console
$ nextflow log goofy_kilby
/Users/../work/0b/be0d1c4b6fd6c778d509caa3565b64
/Users/../work/ec/3100e79e21c28a12ec2204304c1081
/Users/../work/7d/eb4d4471d04cec3c69523aab599fd4
/Users/../work/8f/d5a26b17b40374d37338ccfe967a30
/Users/../work/94/dfdfb63d5816c9c65889ae34511b32
```

### Customizing fields

By default, only the task execution paths are printed. A custom list of fields to print can be provided via the `-f` (`-fields`) option:

```console
$ nextflow log goofy_kilby -f hash,name,exit,status
0b/be0d1c  buildIndex (ggal_1_48850000_49020000.Ggal71.500bpflank)  0  COMPLETED
ec/3100e7  mapping (ggal_gut)                                       0  COMPLETED
7d/eb4d44  mapping (ggal_liver)                                     0  COMPLETED
8f/d5a26b  makeTranscript (ggal_liver)                              0  COMPLETED
94/dfdfb6  makeTranscript (ggal_gut)                                0  COMPLETED
```

The fields accepted by the `-f` options are the ones in the [trace file report][trace-file], as well as: script, stdout, stderr, env. List available fields using the `-l` (`-list-fields`) option.

The `script` field is useful for examining script commands run in each task:

```console
$ nextflow log goofy_kilby -f name,status,script
align_genome      COMPLETED
   bowtie --index /data/genome input.fastq > output
...
```

### Templates

The `-t` option allows a template (string or file) to be specified. This makes it possible to create complex custom reports in any text-based format. For example, you could save this Markdown snippet to a file:

```md
## $name

script:

    $script

exit status: $exit
task status: $status
task folder: $folder
```

Then, the following command will output a markdown file containing the script, exit status and folder of all executed tasks:

```bash
nextflow log goofy_kilby -t my-template.md > execution-report.md
```

### Filtering

The `filter` option makes it possible to select which entries to include in the log report. Any valid groovy boolean expression on the log fields can be used to define the filter condition. For example:

```bash
nextflow log goofy_kilby -filter 'name =~ /hello.*/ && status == "FAILED"'
```

## Execution report

Nextflow can create an HTML execution report: a single document which includes many useful metrics about a workflow execution. The report is organised in the three main sections: `Summary`, `Resources` and `Tasks` (see below for details).

To enable the creation of this report add the `-with-report` command line option when launching the pipeline execution. For example:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-report [file name]
```

The report file name can be specified as an optional parameter following the report option.

### Summary

The `Summary` section reports the execution status, the launch command, overall execution time and some other workflow metadata. You can see an example below:

![Report summary](_static/report-summary-min.png)

### Resource Usage

The `Resources` section plots the distribution of resource usage for each workflow process using the interactive [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) plotting library.

Plots are shown for CPU, memory, job duration and disk I/O. They have two (or three) tabs with the raw values and a percentage representation showing what proportion of the requested resources were used. These plots are very helpful to check that task resources are used efficiently.

![Usage CPUs](_static/report-resource-cpu.png)

See the [Understanding task resource metrics][metrics-page] guide to learn more about how resource usage is computed in Nextflow.

### Tasks

The `Tasks` section lists all executed tasks, reporting for each of them the status, the actual command script, and many other metrics. You can see an example below:

![Tasks](_static/report-tasks-min.png)

:::note
Nextflow collects these metrics through a background process for each job in the target environment. Make sure the following tools are available in the environment where tasks are executed: `awk`, `date`, `grep`, `ps`, `sed`, `tail`, `tee`. Moreover, some of these metrics are not reported when running on Mac OS X. See the corresponding note in the [trace file](#trace-file) section.
:::

:::warning
A common problem when using a third party container image is that it does not include one or more of the above utilities, resulting in an empty execution report.
:::

See [Report scope][config-report] to learn more about the execution report configuration details.

## Trace file

Nextflow creates an execution tracing file that contains some useful information about each process executed in your pipeline script, including: submission time, start time, completion time, cpu and memory used.

In order to create the execution trace file add the `-with-trace` command line option when launching the pipeline execution. For example:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-trace
```

It will create a file named `trace.txt` in the current directory. The content looks similar the above example:

| task_id | hash      | native_id | name           | status    | exit | submit                  | duration | walltime | %cpu   | rss      | vmem     | rchar    | wchar    |

Trace report layout and other configuration settings can be specified by using the `nextflow.config` configuration file.

## Execution timeline

Nextflow can render an HTML timeline for all processes executed in your pipeline. An example of the execution timeline is shown below:

![Execution timeline](_static/timeline-min.png)

Each bar represents a process run in the pipeline execution. The bar length represents the task duration time (wall-time). The colored area in each bar represents the real execution time. The grey area to the *left* of the colored area represents the task scheduling wait time. The grey area to the *right* of the colored area represents the task termination time (clean-up and file un-staging). The numbers on the x-axis represent the time in absolute units e.g. minutes, hours, etc.

Each bar displays two numbers: the task duration time and the virtual memory size peak.

As each process can spawn many tasks, colors are used to identify those tasks belonging to the same process.

To enable the creation of the execution timeline add the `-with-timeline` command line option when launching the pipeline execution. For example:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-timeline [file name]
```

The report file name can be specified as an optional parameter following the timeline option.

## Workflow diagram

A Nextflow pipeline can be represented as a direct acyclic graph (DAG). The vertices in the graph represent the pipeline's processes and operators, while the edges represent the data dependencies (i.e. channels) between them.

To render the workflow DAG, run your pipeline with the `-with-dag` option. By default, it creates a file named `dag-<timestamp>.html` with the workflow DAG rendered as a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram.

The workflow DAG can be rendered in a different format by specifying an output file name with a different extension based on the desired format. For example:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-dag flowchart.png
```

:::{versionadded} 22.06.0-edge
You can use the `-preview` option with `-with-dag` to render the workflow DAG without executing any tasks.
:::

:::{versionchanged} 23.10.0
The default output format was changed from DOT to HTML.

Here is the Mermaid diagram produced by Nextflow for the [rnaseq-nf](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf) pipeline (using the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/edit) with the `default` theme):

```bash
nextflow run rnaseq-nf -preview -with-dag
```

```{mermaid} _static/dag.mmd
