## Notes

The `Nextflow` class implements several methods that are exposed to Nextflow scripts. See {ref}`stdlib-namespaces-global` for details.

The `Channel` class implements the channel factory methods, and it is exposed directly to Nextflow scripts. See {ref}`channel-page` for details.

The `Session` class is the top-level representation of a Nextflow run, or "session". See [nextflow.script](nextflow.script.md) for more details about how a `Session` is created.
