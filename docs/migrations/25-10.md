## Enhancements

<h3>Nextflow plugin registry</h3>

Nextflow now uses the [Nextflow plugin registry](https://registry.nextflow.io/) to download plugins in a more efficient and scalable manner.

The legacy plugin index can still be used by setting the `NXF_PLUGINS_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export NXF_PLUGINS_REGISTRY_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextflow-io/plugins/main/plugins.json"
```

:::{note}
Plugin developers will not be able to submit PRs to the legacy plugin index once the plugin registry is generally available. Plugins should be updated to publish to the Nextflow plugin registry using the {ref}`Nextflow Gradle plugin <gradle-plugin-page>` instead. See {ref}`migrate-plugin-registry-page` for details.

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. You can now define handlers as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. See {ref}`workflow-handlers` for details.

<h3>Improved handling of dynamic directives</h3>

The {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>` allows dynamic process directives to be specified without a closure:

```nextflow
process hello {
    queue (entries > 100 ? 'long' : 'short')

    input:
    tuple val(entries), path('data.txt')

    script:
    """
    your_command --here
    """
}
```

See {ref}`dynamic-directives` for details.

<h3>Configurable date formatting</h3>

You can now customize the date and time format used in notifications, reports, and console output using the `NXF_DATE_FORMAT` environment variable:

```bash
# Default format
# e.g., 11-Aug-2016 09:40:20

# Use ISO format with timezone
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="iso"
# e.g., 2016-08-11T09:40:20+02:00

# Use custom format
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
# e.g., 2016-08-11 09:40
```

This feature addresses previous inconsistencies in timestamp representations.

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See {ref}`the guide <aws-java-sdk-v2-page>` for details.

## Deprecations

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. You should define workflow handlers in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See {ref}`config-workflow-handlers` for details.
